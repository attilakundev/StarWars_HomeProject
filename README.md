# Star Wars project
Scenario: Vader wants to improve his fleet, so he goes into the spaceship store to buy some ships.

So what he can do?
1. He can choose of ships freely (so he can pick his favorite one) and buy it
2. He can delete one choosen ship from the cart OR empty his cart
3. He can check the items in the cart
4. He can check the best offer for his wallet and buy them if he wants to.
5. Also he can check his current fleet

If Vader bought the adequate ships, then if there are remaining ships in the store, he can't buy them, since he bought them all :)
